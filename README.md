# Student Registration Form Project

Welcome to the Student Registration Form project repository! This project demonstrates my skills in front-end development using HTML5, CSS3, Bootstrap5, and JavaScript.

## Project Overview

This project is divided into two main sections:
1. **Form Section**: Allows users to fill out their registration details.
2. **Data Preview Section**: Displays the submitted data dynamically.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML5**: For structuring the web page.
- **CSS3**: For styling and layout.
- **Bootstrap5**: For responsive design and additional styling components.
- **JavaScript**: The main focus of this project, used for various functionalities and validations.

## JavaScript Topics Covered

- **Image Handling with Validation**: Ensuring the selected image meets certain criteria before submission.
- **Form Validation in JavaScript**: Implementing various checks to ensure all required fields are correctly filled.
- **DOM Manipulation in JavaScript**: Dynamically updating the page content based on user interactions.
